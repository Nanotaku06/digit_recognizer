Hello! Welcome to my digit-recognizing algorithm. Here is a bit of information about how it works and how to get it working :D

This machine learning algorithm uses the training dataset from Kaggles digit-recognizer competition. This is where train.csv comes from.
for more information on this competition, please visit https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview.

For this algorithm, we are using sklearns KNeighborsClassifier library. For this, I had to install miniconda, and create a personalized environment/kernel
that allowed me to import the libraries in the first place. THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT, but it was what worked for me.

In it, you can use .jpg or .png image files (others might work, idk I havent tested it). You can also use both gray scale and color images,
dark or bright backgrounds, and whatever resolution image you want! (Built some handy data manipulation algorithms to handle these cases. Fun stuff really)

Hope you like it!
